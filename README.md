# NamePlateUnitFilter
World of Warcraft AddOn to filter unit nameplates based on unit name. Filtered units still retain enabled nameplates, but are modified to have no health bars, smaller and more translucent name text, and smaller cast bars.

The main purpose of this addon is to provide a way to "hide" certain units that clutter the screen such as Wild Imps or Army of the Dead, mainly in PvP scenarios, while still keeping the generic nameplate categories on for other important targets such as totems or psyfiend.

# NamePlate Unit Filter
NPUF is a World of Warcraft AddOn for filtering unit nameplates based on unit name. Filtered units still retain enabled nameplates, but are modified to have no health bars, smaller and more translucent name text, and smaller cast bars.

The main purpose of this addon is to provide a way to "hide" certain units that clutter the screen such as Wild Imps or Army of the Dead, mainly in PvP scenarios, while still keeping the generic nameplate categories on for other important targets such as totems or psyfiend.

This addon also aims to allow unit filtering without the need of a huge addon package that applies skins and drastically changes the UI look and feel.

Note: This project is currently in-progress. While the main filtering logic is functional, the addon does not yet have several intended quality-of-life features to ensure convenient use. Make sure to check back regularly for updates!
